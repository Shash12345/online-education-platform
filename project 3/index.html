                            acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, habits, and personal development.
                            Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed
                            research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators; however,
                            learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal
                            settings, and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or
                            acts may be considered educational.</p>

                            out to be a major “silent hindrance” for India’s track to greater development. While all the
                            attention is on social-political issues, it should quickly be turned on to educational
                            reforms. Education has the power to all solve issues(wars, unemployment, waste management,
                            corruption etc), in the long run, and a must for a developing country like India it cannot
                            be ignored, not to say it is being ignored, India spends a lot of Education( somewhat only
                            2nd after defence), the results aren’t actually visible….

                            the knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this
                            was achieved orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and
                            skills from one generation to the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond
                            skills that could be readily learned through imitation, formal education developed. Schools
                            existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle Kingdom.</p>
